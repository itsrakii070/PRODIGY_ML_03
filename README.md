# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Classification using SVM

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of **cats** and **dogs** using the [Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).

---

## 📌 Overview

The model uses:
- Grayscale image conversion
- Resizing and flattening
- (Optional) HOG feature extraction
- SVM classification

This lightweight approach is suitable for quick experimentation on smaller image sets.

## 📁 Dataset

- Download the dataset from Kaggle: [Dogs vs. Cats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)
- After downloading:
  - Extract `train.zip`
  - Place the extracted files in a folder called `train/` in your project directory
